/*
 * mktime64 - Converts date to seconds.
 * Converts Gregorian date to seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00.
 * Assumes input in normal date format, i.e. 1980-12-31 23:59:59
 * => year=1980, mon=12, day=31, hour=23, min=59, sec=59.
 *
 * [For the Julian calendar (which was used in Russia before 1917,
 * Britain & colonies before 1752, anywhere else before 1582,
 * and is still in use by some communities) leave out the
 * -year/100+year/400 terms, and add 10.]
 *
 * This algorithm was first published by Gauss (I think).

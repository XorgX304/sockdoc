This project has programming examples to accompany a textbook I'm working on for 
advanced network programming topics. This text will focus on scalability, reliability,
security, and portability. The goal is rather than teaching programmers who to create
prototypes that might work, but which fail in the real world, how to finish programs
so that they work correctly when exposed to the rigors of the public Internet.

I'm working on this text now (August 2019) and have no clue when I'll be done, but 
probably at least a year from now.
